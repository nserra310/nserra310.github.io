                    <p>My name is Nicholas Serra, I have lived in San Deigo for a little over 5 years. Originally moved
                        out here to go to school for animation but decided to switch to Web Development. I have only
                        been coding in HTML5 and CSS for the past two months and starting to get the feel for how the
                        two work together in order to build fully functioning websites.
                        <br>Upon completing this bootcamp I hope to build a strong protfolio in order to get a job doing web
                        dev for a company in San Deigo. Utimately I'd like to work for a company in San Diego for a
                        while and gain enough experience to be able to move to Washington and work remotely. </p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>Althought coding is still new to me I hope to also use skills learned at the Art Institute to apply
                animation to websites in order to make them more appealing visually to the viewers. In my spare time I
                enjoy skateboarding, snowboarding, surfing, hiking, reading, drawing, and running. I am also learning
                how to play the paino in my spare time as well.</p>
